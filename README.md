<h1>Port - Version Alpha 0.05</h1>
<p>
Current chat applications are dull at best, not to mention owned by you-know-who.
        
I believe there's a better way to use the latest web technologies to create communication systems that are not only functional but also whimsical and pleasurable. And should we feel bad that we're supporting huge, sometimes terrible companies whenever we want to communicate with our loved ones? Is this the best we can come up with? Telegram (literally a Whatsapp clone)?

With this project I'm creating the communication system I'd love to use, however long it takes.

This means:
<ul>
        <li>A fluid and animated UI that's a joy to use.</li>
        <li>P2P transfers with pause/resume for audio/video/data messages
        (for added versatility under all network conditions, plus independence from expensive infrastructures).
        <li> Effortless multi-device funtionality with no 'buts'.</li>
        <li>No locking of data to a closed ecosysem. Easy import and export. Compatibility with other protocols if possible.</li>   
        <li>Signal-level encryption.</li>
        <li>Unique, fun communication features. Some top secret stuff here...</li>
</ul>
What you see is a working alpha version on which to build upon. It has the following features so far:
<ul>
        <li>Private text-based conversations.</li>
        <li>Live typing with chat partner.</li>
        <li>Only username needed to use.</li>
        <li>Only contact's username needed to connect with them.</li>
        <li>Optional account creation to save chats and contacts.</li>
        <li>Dark mode all the things forever.</li>
</ul>
